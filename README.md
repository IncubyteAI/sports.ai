# Sports.AI
Hey ðŸ‘‹ This is the official github repo for sports.ai, an AI-based startup founded by 3 highschool freshmen, Tanay Agrawal (@YanatPlayz), Daniel Zhu (@devo1ution), and Pascal Qin.

Sports.ai is an innovative tool for sports coaching and provides real-time feedback to players. Our technology uses artificial intelligence to analyze player performance through mobile videos and offer personalized insights.

## RData folder
The RData folder that contains all the training data (videos and annotations) is not included in this repository due to the amount of memory they occupy. Please ask our team for the dataset separately.
## Removing Spaces
If the RData file you import is formatted with "Stage X" in folders and filenames instead of "StageX", run `source rm_spaces.sh` to remove these spaces.
